# Build Tomorrow Today.™

## Jomi Cubol is an interdisciplinary product strategist and designer focused on transformative software.

I combine product, design, engineering, data, and philosophy to build technology and spread ideas that advance society.

Most recently, I worked at Condé Nast where I designed numerous products, led teams, and helped create a universal design system for all of its portfolio brands (GQ, Vogue, WIRED, The New Yorker, Vanity Fair, among others). Before that, I designed mobile apps and enterprise software for startups.

My mission is to democratize opportunity through technology to build a better future for humanity.
