MESSAGE


Hi.

I am not sure how you found this message, 
but I hope you are doing well whoever you are.

You likely clicked View Source for whatever reason.

Yes this entire website was hand-crafted. If hand-crafted means 
learning from the many people I deeply admire and being influenced by 
their design taste, philosophies, and principles.

And of course, learning from the World Wide Web.


I love the Web because it is easily the most powerful thing
created in our generation. I was born in 1990 in a middle-class
family in the Philippines and I clearly remember what my life was like
before, and what my life was like after the proliferation of the Web.

I remember what it was like before Google and after it.
I remember what it was like before Wikipedia and after it.
Blogging, all the social networks, apps, and what have you.

Right now as I write this in March of 2016, we are in the before-VR and
very soon we will know what it is like after it. It has the potential to be
the next platform, as mobile has been the past two decades.

Who knows.


All I know is I love the Web. And I want to help build things on it
because it has done so much for me. I still know very little. But I am hellbent
on getting better, in order to make things that can empower people at scale.


It will take time. It will take a lot of hard work.
The exciting part is: we are still at the very beginning.
We have the power to create the future. But it will only happen if we choose to.


And I am up for it because I cannot see myself doing anything else.


I hope you join me.
