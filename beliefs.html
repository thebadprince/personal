			<h3>On Economic Growth</h3>
      <ol class="beliefs">
				<li><strong>Economic growth</strong> is imperative for the long-term peace and prosperity of humanity. It provides better standard of living, longer lifespans, lower mortality rates, and more general fulfillment. This results in more trade and collaboration and less interpersonal and international competition, and thus less violence, crime, and war.</li>
				<!-- Lack of economic growth may result in the opposite and has serious ramifications for the future of the population. -->
				<li>We must dare to create new things if we want economic growth. <strong>Technology</strong> that leads to significant productivity gains, wealth, and employment is an extremely important driver of economic growth.</li>
				<!-- Simply accepting the status quo will not create enough economic growth to support growing populations, rising costs, and inflation. -->
				<li>To build new technology that contributes to a net positive at scale, we need to <strong>widen opportunity, mobility, and access</strong> for as many people to be able to contribute. There is no limit to man’s creativity therefore the more people that can build technology and build <em>with</em> technology, the more potential for economic growth there will be.</li>
				<li>“For as many people” means including and especially <strong>underrepresented communities and neglected groups</strong> whose diverse experiences, perspectives, and skillsets can only add to a richer sphere of technological possibilities, more intelligent discourse, and more active participation from the population.</li>
				<li>The future won’t design itself. Those who have vision and ability to create it have a <strong>moral obligation</strong> of doing so, setting up the next generation of builders to propel further economic growth that has a lasting impact on society's trajectory long after they're gone.</li>
      </ol>
