			<p>This list makes up my <strong>current</strong> operating system. It's based on experience, <a href="/library.html">accumulated knowledge</a>,  and shifting perspective. These are less absolute truths and more a distillation of what gives me purpose & motivation and how I arrived at my <a href="/index.html">mission</a>.</p>

				<li><a href="">Belief 1</a>: Individuality is the most important asset.</li>

			<h3>Individuality is the Most Underrated Asset</h3>

			<h4>Real individuality is starved, scarce, and sanitized. We need real individuality more than ever.</h4>


			<p>Because attention is the primary currency, the tendency is to arrive at the average of what gets the most attention rather than what has depth, what is vulnerable, what is genuine. We are becoming a generation of marketers instead of artists. I’m not saying marketing is bad, I’m saying it can’t come as a precedent or the motivation before the art. But today this seems to be the case more often than not.</p>

			<p>Art can be marketed to make it seem more valuable, more important, more influential. But its essence—what an artist seeks to reveal and communicate and express through their art—is a one-time event. How popular it ends up being has no bearing on the initial explosion of emotion. Even if that was partly the intention in mind, the artist always knows if she robbed herself in exchange for some external reward. The artist always knows if he sold himself short and settled for what’s good enough instead of what was calling him to be great. The world may celebrate in your glory or criticize you incessantly or not care at all. But real artists are only concerned about being true to their craft and their art, which is an extension of themselves, an embodiment of their being, a manifestation of their soul.</p>

			<p>For an artist, of course it’s important what to get in return, but not at the sacrifice of what it is they have to give. But we are in an age where the tables have turned. And as a result, we have more of the same, stuck in an infinite loop of copying what’s hot or trendy, and in fear of delving into the uncertain, flirting with the unpopular, experimenting with the unknown. We sacrifice our individual freedom for false sense of security. Afraid to say the things we think, be the person we want to be, do the things we wish to do. We don’t want to offend anyone, least of all the self-righteous mob, who are quick to be outraged at something based on an external belief set jammed down their throats because they haven’t done the hard work of creating an internal perspective which would require asking hard questions there aren’t any easy answers to. And because everyone else is doing it and it’s easier to be a part of a collective whose thoughts are already clear cut and sold wholesale than be a person of one’s own making with one’s own voice and opinions and goals. We are afraid of being disliked, misunderstood, seen as different, be shunned from the tribe.</p>

			<p>We will sacrifice what the heart yearns for the acceptance of the crowd, most of whom is also playing it safe, scared of upsetting anyone, satisfied with the bare minimum, never rattling the cage, suppressing the child inside who wonders, who dares, who imagines.</p>

			<p>This is not the mark of an enlightened society. Or a free society. Or a fulfilled society. We cannot strictly be transactional. We cannot bury the soul for the sake of obvious rewards.</p>

			<p>We need individuality more than ever. Our intellectual, psychological, and spiritual freedom depends upon it. Our society as a whole depends upon it. How we save our own individuality, how we carve our own sense of self, how strongly we apply our uniqueness onto the world in our own fashion, collectively, is how society will remember us.</p>

			<!-- <h3>The Importance of Economic Growth and the Role of Technology &amp; Individuality</h3> -->

      <ol class="beliefs">
				<li><strong>Economic growth is imperative for the long-term peace and prosperity of humanity.</strong> It creates better standards of living, longer lifespans, lower mortality rates, and more general fulfillment. Lack of economic growth may result in the opposite and has serious ramifications for the future of the population.<a href="#section1" id="ref1"><sup>1</sup></a></li>

				<!-- This results in more trade and collaboration and less interpersonal and international competition, and thus less violence, crime, and war.  -->

				<li><strong>We must dare to create new things if we want economic growth that can advance humanity as a whole.</strong> Technology that leads to significant continuous productivity gains, wealth, and employment is an extremely important driver of economic growth. Progress made today can alter the trajectory of society tomorrow.</li>

				<!-- (That said, not everything needs to “change the world.” As long as it has value to a group of people, that's a welcome improvement.) Simply accepting the status quo or copying existing things will not create enough economic growth which can lead to a rise in unhealthy group, individual, and international competition. On one extreme you have innovation that advances humanity as a whole; on the other you have increased violence, crime, and war. I like the former. -->

				<li><strong>We must have the courage work on hard valuable problems</strong> that move the needle on what's possible if we want meaningful economic growth that coincides with greater sustainability, happiness, and long-term vision for the future.</li>

				<li><strong>We need to widen opportunity, mobility, and access to serve as many people.</strong> There is no limit to man’s creativity, therefore the more people that can build technology and build <em>with</em> technology, the more potential for economic growth there will be.</li>

				<li><strong>We need diverse experiences, perspectives, skill sets, and interests to solve a wide range of problems.</strong>  This can only add to a richer sphere of technological possibilities, more intelligent discourse, and more active participation from the population. Outcomes of economic growth only going to a concentrated minority limits the potential technology that can be created.</li>

				<li><strong>We need tools to empower and promote genuine individuality.</strong> Individuality tied to a strong purpose enables man's greatest contribution.</strong> It helps connect people with their character, their gifts, their potential, and their art instead of strictly catering to the ego and obvious rewards which are ephemeral in nature and create skewed incentives. Such individuality can lead to greater economic, creative, and psychological freedom.</li>

				<li><strong>The best leaders have a palpable energy about them that is infectious, confident, and mission-driven.</strong> They have real skill, inspiring vision, strong strategic decision-making, and relentless execution. They are focused on tangible progress and are focused on what they can give more than what they can get. They are driven by the long-term and bring others with them for the ride.</li>

				<li><strong>Work ought to be challenging.</strong> We find deep meaning in doing our best, finding out what we're made of, and making things happen in spite of how difficult they may be, not in merely lounging in comfort. Business books and thought leaders say many things on how to develop organizational culture, but winning (sustainably, ethically, strategically at the right things) is the most important factor.</li>

				<li><strong>Taste is the great equalizer.</strong> You can have the biggest war chest, most distinguished pedigree, most connected network, but there is still one thing none of those things can simply buy and that is taste. Taste is the combination of product smarts, technical capacity, and distribution strategy to manifest it to life. It may take time for the market and society at large to catch up to that taste, but eventually the score reveals itself.</li>

				<li>The future won’t design itself. Those who have vision and ability to create it have a moral obligation of doing so to create a better society. It also sets up the next generation of builders that can contribute to humanity's peace and prosperity. We have to look forward and actively build the future.

				<br><br><strong>We must build tomorrow today</strong>.</li>

			<p id="section1" class="footnote"><strong>&#xE149;</strong> I've seen firsthand what lack of economic growth looks like while growing up in the Philippines. It's better today, but there was significant income disparity, widespread corruption, underinvested infrastructure, and poor healthcare &amp; education systems (unless you can afford it which is very expensive) reducing faith in the country's economic prospects in the future. This results in civil unrest and valuable human capital searching for better lives elsewhere, as was the case for my family. <br><br> In more extreme scenarios, declining economic growth leads to violence, crime, and war. This is why healthy economies are necessary. Without peace and prosperity, humans are focused strictly on survival and less on higher order things like human welfare, purpose, potential, imagination, and innovation. <a href="#ref1">↩</a></p>
