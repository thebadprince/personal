      <ol class="beliefs">
				<li><strong>Economic growth</strong> is imperative for the peace and prosperity of our civilization.</li>
				<li>We must dare to create new things if we want economic growth. <strong>Technology</strong> that leads to significant productivity gains, wealth, and employment is an extremely important driver of economic growth.</li>
				<li>To build new technology at scale, we need to <strong>widen opportunity, mobility, and access</strong> for as many people to be able to contribute. There is no limit to man’s creativity therefore the more people that can build technology and build <em>with</em> technology, the more economic growth there will be.</li>
				<li>“For as many people” means including and especially <strong>underrepresented communities</strong> whose diverse experiences, perspectives, and skillsets can only add to a richer sphere of technological possibilities, more intelligent discourse, and more active participation from the population.</li>
				<li>The future won’t design itself. Those who have vision and ability to create it have a <strong>moral obligation</strong> of doing so, setting up the next generation of builders to propel further economic growth that has a lasting impact on society's trajectory long after they're gone.</li>
