			<h2 class="title">Beliefs</h2>

			<p>My belief set is my <strong>current</strong> operating system. It's based on experience, <a href="/library.html">accumulated knowledge</a>, and shifting perspective. These are less absolute truths and more a distillation of what gives me purpose & motivation and how I arrived at my <a href="/index.html">mission</a>.</p>

			<h3>The Importance of Economic Growth</h3>
      <ol class="beliefs">
				<li><strong>Economic growth</strong> is imperative for the long-term peace and prosperity of humanity. It creates better standards of living, longer lifespans, lower mortality rates, and more general fulfillment. Lack of economic growth may result in the opposite and has serious ramifications for the future of the population.<a href="#section1" id="ref1"><sup>1</sup></a></li>
				<!-- This results in more trade and collaboration and less interpersonal and international competition, and thus less violence, crime, and war.  -->
				<li>We must dare to create new things if we want economic growth that can advance humanity as a whole. <strong>Technology</strong> that leads to significant continuous productivity gains, wealth, and employment is an extremely important driver of economic growth.</li>
				<!-- (That said, not everything needs to “change the world.” As long as it has value to a group of people, that's a welcome improvement.) Simply accepting the status quo or copying existing things will not create enough economic growth which can lead to a rise in unhealthy group, individual, and international competition. On one extreme you have innovation that advances humanity as a whole; on the other you have increased violence, crime, and war. I like the former. -->
				<li>To accelerate how we can build technology, we need to <strong>widen opportunity, mobility, and access</strong> for as many people to be able to contribute. There is no limit to man’s creativity therefore the more people that can build technology and build <em>with</em> technology, the more potential for economic growth there will be.</li>
				<li>“For as many people” means including and especially <strong>underrepresented communities and neglected groups</strong> whose diverse experiences, perspectives, and skillsets can only add to a richer sphere of technological possibilities, more intelligent discourse, and more active participation from the population.</li>
				<!-- Outcomes of economic growth only going to a concentrated minority limits the potential technology that can be created. -->
				<li>The future won’t design itself. Those who have vision and ability to create it have a moral obligation of doing so to propel further economic growth that has a lasting impact on society's trajectory long after they're gone and to set up the next generation of builders that can continue humanity's peace and prosperity. <strong>We must build tomorrow today</strong>.</li>
      </ol>

			<p id="section1" class="footnote"><strong>[1]</strong> I've seen firsthand what lack of economic growth looks like while growing up in the Philippines. It's certainly much better today, but there was (and continues to be) wide income disparity, corruption, underinvested infrastructure, and poor healthcare and education systems (unless you can afford it which is very expensive) reducing faith in the country's economic prospects in the future. This results in valuable human capital searching for better lives elsewhere, as was the case for my family. <a href="#ref1">↩</a></p>
