			<h3>Why We Need a Better Future, and How We'll Build It Together</h3>

      <ol class="beliefs">
				<li><strong>Economic growth that seeks to advance humanity's knowledge and well-being is imperative for the long-term peace and prosperity of society.</strong> It creates better standards of living, better ways of working, longer lifespans, lower mortality rates, better healthcare &amp; education systems, and more fulfilling lives for more people. Lack of economic growth may result in the opposite and has serious ramifications for the future of the population.<a href="#section1" id="ref1"><sup>1</sup></a></li>

				<!-- This results in more trade and collaboration and less interpersonal and international competition, and thus less violence, crime, and war.  -->

				<li><strong>We must dare to create new things if we want economic growth not just for the sake of profits but the betterment of society and the longevity of the planet.</strong> Technology that leads to significant progress in science &amp; commerce, productivity gains, wealth, and employment is an extremely important driver of economic growth. Progress made today can alter the trajectory of society tomorrow.</li>

				<!-- (That said, not everything needs to “change the world.” As long as it has value to a group of people, that's a welcome improvement.) Simply accepting the status quo or copying existing things will not create enough economic growth which can lead to a rise in unhealthy group, individual, and international competition. On one extreme you have innovation that advances humanity as a whole; on the other you have increased violence, crime, and war. I like the former. -->

				<li><strong>We must have the courage <em>and</em> patience to work on hard valuable problems.</strong> Hard problems challenge creativity and push the needle on what's possible. By virtue of building something new, there's no blueprint for it but you choose to do it anyway because you believe it needs to exist in the world. Having a stomach for the long-term and endurance in the face of setbacks is vital because new things take time to get built, get right, and get adopted.</li>

				<li><strong>We need to widen opportunity, mobility, and access to serve as many people as possible.</strong> Diverse experiences, perspectives, skill sets, and interests will help solve a wider range of problems. This can only add to a richer sphere of technological possibilities, more intelligent discourse, and more active participation from the population. There is no limit to man’s creativity, therefore the more people that can build technology and build <em>with</em> technology, the more potential for economic growth there will be.<a href="#section2" id="ref2"><sup>2</sup></a></li>

				<li><strong>We need to spread genuine individuality and a love for the pursuit of truth.</strong> Individuality tied to a strong purpose enables man's greatest contribution. It helps people connect with their character, their gifts, their potential, and their art. We need to pursue truth and not merely accept what is spoonfed by the powers that be or manufacture narratives that are consistent with our biases. A more enlightened individuality can lead to greater economic, creative, and psychological freedom. The pursuit of truth leads to a more cultivated and more intellectually honest—rather than an intellectually bankrupt—society.</li>

				<li><strong>Work ought to be meaningfully challenging.</strong> We find deep sense of meaning in giving our best towards something we believe in. We grow the most when we discover our true potential in the midst of difficulty. Growth through the right level of challenge met with a sense of purpose is what creates fulfillment, not endless moments of comfort and predictability. When it comes to organizational culture, winning sustainably, ethically, and strategically at the right things that gives us autonomy, mastery, and purpose is the most important factor.</li>

				<li><strong>Great technology teams are the heart of great technology companies.</strong>Talent matters but only so far as the cohesion of the team and to the degree the team puts its objectives first, front, and center. After laying out a compelling vision and a strong strategy by leadership, there is the execution driven by the culture, momentum, and velocity of its team. Strong team dynamics lead to talent working not just <em>with</em> each other but also <em>for</em> each other. This is how mountains are moved in spite of challenging constraints.</li>

				<li><strong>Monomaniacal focus is an underutilized competitive advantage.</strong> Everyone knows focus is good but few truly have the capacity, the discipline, and the patience for laser-like  focus. It requires one to be obsessively strategic about which path to take and which activities have the greatest leverage. It's deciding 1) what different things you'll do, and 2) what things you'll do differently from others. It’s about saying no to everything else that doesn't fit with your strategy no matter the temptation, pressure, criticism, or loneliness you may face.<a href="#section3" id="ref3"><sup>3</sup></a></li>

				<li><strong>Taste is the great equalizer.</strong> You can have the most capital, the most distinguished pedigree, the most connected network, even the biggest brand, but there is still one thing none of those things can simply get: taste. Taste is a deep instinctual understanding of humans—what drives them, how they work, how they feel—and creating things that evoke a powerful want and need, matched with how it will work in the real world. It may take time for the market and society to catch up to that taste, but you can feel good taste when you see it.<a href="#section4" id="ref4"><sup>4</sup></a></li>

				<li><strong>We must build tomorrow today.</strong> The future won’t design itself. Those who have vision and ability to create it have a moral obligation of doing so to create a better society. It also sets up the next generation of builders that can contribute to humanity's peace and prosperity. We have to look forward and actively build the future. The world is counting on you and me and all of us.</li>

			<p id="section1" class="footnote"><strong><span class="footnote_number">&#xE149;</span></strong> I've seen firsthand what lack of economic growth looks like while growing up in the Philippines. It's better today, but there was—and still to some extent—significant income disparity, widespread corruption, underinvested infrastructure, and poor healthcare &amp; education systems (unless you can afford it which is very expensive) reducing faith in the country's economic prospects in the future. This results in civil unrest and valuable human capital searching for better lives elsewhere, as was the case for my family. In more extreme scenarios, declining economic growth leads to violence, crime, and war. This is why healthy economies are necessary: without it, humans are focused strictly on survival and competition and less on higher order things like human welfare, purpose, potential, imagination, and innovation. <a href="#ref1">↩</a></p>

			<p id="section2" class="footnote"><strong><span class="footnote_number">&#xE140;</span></strong> I wouldn't be the person I am today if I didn't get the exposure to technology that I did, and being able to develop a technical foundation early on thanks to my parents' hard work of sending me to a school in the Philippines that taught it. This is why I'm hellbent on opportunity as a catalyst for progress. To understand more, <a href="/bio.html">read my bio</a>. <a href="#ref2">↩</a></p>

			<!-- <p id="section3" class="footnote"><strong><span class="footnote_number">&#xE14A;</span></strong> Building new technology requires courage because by virtue of something being new, there is no blueprint for it and the risk of failure is higher but you choose to do it anyway. It requires patience because new things take time to get built, get right, and get adopted. You can absolutely do everything to push it into existence and generate adoption but systems will still have a delay as it responds to change. This is why having the stomach for the long-term is just as important as the ability to move fast. <a href="#ref3">↩</a></p> -->

			<p id="section3" class="footnote"><strong><span class="footnote_number">&#xE14A;</span></strong> You will have to make <strong>an extremely specific choice on what to focus on</strong> because tradeoffs are inevitable and you will have to make compromises. This choice will form your identity and decision-making process. It's about having distinct positioning that gives way for things you can do well <em>together</em> and removing anything that isn't consistent with the rest of your activities or doesn't make them better. Without this, you are competing for the lowest common denominator rather than creating true differentiation. <a href="#ref3">↩</a></p>

			<p id="section4" class="footnote"><strong><span class="footnote_number">&#xE14B;</span></strong> Out of everything here, this may be the hardest to get right, specifically because there's no equation or training that can easily produce great taste. It's abstract. It's visceral. It takes intuition, a disdain for the status quo, and extreme care for detail. It requires a balancing act of idealism and realism. It's a mix of imagination and really really <em>really</em> giving a damn. <a href="#ref4">↩</a></p>
