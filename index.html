Some shout outs. I wouldn't be where I am and where I'm going if it weren't for:

Mom, Dad, and my older brother Jof.
My grandparents, each of whom are my biggest inspirations.
Steve Jobs & Bill Gates for starting the PC industry.
Alan Kay and XEROX Parc for creating the graphical user interface.
Tim Berners-Lee for inventing the world wide web.
Marc Andreesen and Jim Barksdale for founding Netscape.
The Philippines for birthing me.
The City of Yonkers for raising me.
Cam'Ron for teaching me New York slang.
New York City, the best city in the world.
Tom of MySpace for essentially giving me a career without me even knowing it.
Nu Alpha Phi for giving me a foundation.
Sam Tran, Ed Fernandez, Michele & Frank Spiezia, Tom Gebauer, Cortney Cassidy, and Brooke Ellis for giving me a shot.
Everyone I have worked with in the past and everyone I will work with in the future.
Everyone I've ever met, each of whom is my teacher.

			<h1>Design The Future.&trade;</h1>

			<div class="section_summary">
				<p>My name is Jomi Cubol.</p>

				<p>I’m a product strategist, designer, and hacker.</p>

				<p>A perpetual optimist passionate about the intersection of technology, economics, philosophy, and culture.</p>

				<p>My mission is to advance humanity with bold ideas, powerful software, and beautiful design.</p>

				<p>Most recently, I was at <a href="http://condenast.com" target=_blank>Condé Nast</a> where I helped build numerous products, led teams, and designed systems for all of its portfolio brands, serving an audience of more than 100 million readers every month. Before that, I designed consumer applications and enterprise software for startups.</p>

				<p>I went to the University at Albany where I studied English and Journalism with a focus on the future of media. Prior to college, I went to high school in Yonkers, New York where I grew my passion for the arts, dance, theater, and design. I moved from Manila, Philippines where I studied information technology, mechanical & electrical engineering, and industrial drafting from an early age.</p>

				<p>I believe I was born to imagine the future, create solutions to challenging problems, build technology that can be used to accelerate progress, and lead and inspire others to do the same. I’m looking for those who feel the same things very strongly.</p>

				<p>If you fit that description, or have a specific vision for a better future, feel free to get in touch.</p>

				<p>Where we go from here is a choice I leave to you.</p>
