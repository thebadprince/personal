DESIGN THE FUTURE.™


Some shout outs. I wouldn't be where I am and where I'm going if it weren't for:

Mom, Dad, and my older brother Jof.
My grandparents, each of whom are my biggest inspirations.
Steve Jobs & Bill Gates for starting the PC industry.
Alan Kay and XEROX Parc for creating the graphical user interface.
Tim Berners-Lee for inventing the world wide web.
Marc Andreesen and Jim Barksdale for founding Netscape.
The Philippines for birthing me.
The City of Yonkers for raising me.
Cam'Ron for teaching me New York slang.
New York City, the best city in the world.
Tom of MySpace for essentially giving me a career without me even knowing it.
Nu Alpha Phi for giving me a foundation.
Sam Tran, Ed Fernandez, Michele & Frank Spiezia, Tom Gebauer, Cortney Cassidy, and Brooke Ellis for giving me a shot.
Everyone I have worked with in the past and everyone I will work with in the future.
Everyone I've ever met, each of whom is my teacher.

...and you for reading this.

				<h3> Jomi Cubol is a Product Strategist.</h3>

				<p>I use <strong>design, engineering, and data</strong> to build powerful  beautiful software that makes tomorrow better than what it is today.</p>

				<p>I study <strong>philosophy</strong> (reason), <strong>economics</strong> (markets), <strong>psychology</strong></strong> (incentives), and <strong>systems</strong> (flow) to create a framework for product development.</p>

				<!-- <p>I value boldness, long-term thinking, curiosity, preparation, focus, execution, teamwork & trust, intellectual honesty, commitment to excellence, and continuous improvement.</p> -->

				<p>Most recently, I worked at <a href="http://condenast.com">Condé Nast</a> where I designed numerous products, led teams, and helped build a universal design system for all of its portfolio brands (including GQ, Vogue, The New Yorker, Vanity Fair, among others). Before that, I designed mobile apps and enterprise software for startups.</p>

				<p>My mission is to <strong>democratize opportunity through technology</strong> to drive <a href="/beliefs.html">long-term economic growth</a>.</p>

				<!-- <p>I went to the University at Albany where I studied English and Journalism with a focus on the future of media.</p> -->
