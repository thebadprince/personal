  		<h2>Currently</h2>
  				<p>My main objective: learn how to fully build a product from scratch, from strategy, to design, and all the way to implementation.</p>

  				<p>While I'm versed in the first two, forcing myself to work more in code—both <a href="https://www.codecademy.com/en/learn/web" target="_blank">on the web</a> and <a href="https://designcode.io/">on mobile</a>—helps me jump out of my comfort zone and work my vision faster. At the same time, it would help me dig deeper and explore new interface possibilities and extend both my visual design skills and ability to prototype in code environment.<p>

  				<p>Other than that, I'm trying to meditate and journal for 30 straight days (for starts). I'm also doing a modified <a href="http://www.bodybuilding.com/fun/mike-ohearn-power-bodybuilding-12-week-program.html">powerbuilding program</a> to build on my strength and retain muscle. My diet is on maintenance until I get the hang of my design-in-code objective. For the meantime, my goal is to get back to form and comfortably deadlift 315lbs, squat 225 lbs, and bench 135 lbs on reps.</p>

  				<p>I'll try to update this page every month from here on out.</p>
