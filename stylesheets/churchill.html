  			<div class="thesis">Reinventing the online job application process, making it more inviting, more personal, and more human.</div>


			<p>After revamping <a href="http://apploi.com" target="_blank">Apploi</a>’s <a href="http://jomicubol.com.truman.html">enterprise dashboard</a>, it was natural that we rethink our consumer-facing product, which comprises of our job search mechanism and the application process that job seekers use to apply to those jobs.</p>

			<p>The business challenge was to increase activation (sign-ups and started applications)‚ and conversion rates (submitted applications) to get more people to use the system and increase the chances of these users getting hired. If we create a better mechanism that can feed our supply-side (the companies looking to hire workers in service industries), we create a healthier ecosystem that helps more people get jobs.</p>

			<p>Apploi’s differentiator is users can answer video, text, and multiple choice questions directly through the application, enabling them to showcase their personality while also making the screening process more effective, and efficient for both the job seeker and the hiring manager.</p>

			<p>Our goal as a team is to build this application process from the ground up, enhancing the overall user experience, creating a new visual language, and thus making what’s usually an anxiety-filled process to be easier, faster, and more enjoyable to use than the status quo and other competitors in the market. We would call it Project Churchill.</p>


			<h2>ANALYZING THE OLD APPLICATION</h2>

			<p>Before any new design work was done, we analyzed the status of the current product, did usability tests on new and existing users, while also trying to gain as much context regarding other products in the same field.</p>

			<p>The old product didn’t exactly have a great design, both from an aesthetic or a usability standpoint. It didn’t possess consistent styling, didn’t adhere to a user-friendly grid, and users had issues mapping where they were on an application or how far they had to go. Still, this same product was able to get a ton of people to apply to jobs. It was our goal to dramatically increase success rates and repeat usage of the app.</p>
